# Data Science With Python

“Data science”, which is a big term. This course will introduce the analysis steps, methods, and their scenarios. Hope it can be a lighthouse to point out the way which resolves problems concretely.

This course will cover the clarification of confusing terminology, basic and statistical plotting, pandas and numpy, how to reduce variables, statistical hypothesis testing and regression, machine learning classification and clustering. Moreover, all of the above are introduced in plain Python.

It won't cover all details, but will cover most of the link and their introductions.

It was a course in PyLadies Taiwan in 2017/12 and 2018 NCCU PyDay.
